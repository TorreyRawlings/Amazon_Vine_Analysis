#### Summary:
    It doesn't look there there is much of a bias for Vine members to be more likely to give a 5 star review than a non-Vine member. In fact non-Vine members seems to give a slightly higher percentage of 5 stars by 5%. Due to this it may seem as though companies should perhaps not pay the extra fee for Vine members. Before making this decision though it would be helpful to do an analysis on the percentage of 1 & 2 star reviews to see if Vine members are less likely to give bad reviews or if that is also the same amount as non-Vine members.
